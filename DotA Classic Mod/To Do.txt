Bugs:
-Having multiple items that have the same effect that doesnt stack, you will lose that effect when you drop one of these items.
E.g. Basilius and Aquila have same aura with different numbers. Dropping one of them make you lose that aura, unless you drop both and pick one up again.

-CD of CD-Manipulated Skills through talents/perks are not shown in tooltips anymore. Same for manacost.

Balance Improvements:
-Only main creeps of a camp can drop neutral items, higher chance for ancient main creeps.
-Only one neutral item can be carried but in normal slots. 
-Bounty runes reduced to 2.
-No Shrines, outposts.
-Neutral items can be sold for small injection of money.
