Restoring DotA's old glory with some QOL elements and tweaks



Tweaks contain hero specific perks (think of 1-branched talents that become stronger with each levelup), 
old kill and gold mechanics before the introduction of "comeback mechanic",
non-linear XP Progress as it used to be.



QoL: UI Improvements




**Now Implemented:

-XP per level required as in 6.88

-Stats from attributes slightly altered to be a mix between 6.8 era and modern dota, i.e.

  19 HP / str   0.05 Hp / sec / str (6.88: 0.03/sec and 20 HP)  default base reg: 0.15 (6.88: 0.25)   Base HP: 180 (6.88: 200)
  
  13 mana / int (6.88: 12 mana)  0.05 Mana / sec / int (6.88: 0.04)  Base Mana: 50 (6.88: 75)
  
  mana regen item like in modern dota (stronger early, worse ultra late)
  
  1 armor / 7 agi, old armor formula (slightly stronger than current)
  1% spell amp / 14 int
  
-Added PMS / Aquila / Trident / Talon / Vambrace to main shop

-Better shop layout

-Attributes and stat gain of all heroes reverted to 6.88 (1-2 exceptions)

-approx. 15% of items have gold prices and recipes now reverted to 6.88 (work in progress)

-neutral drops reduced to 10. Most are only sweet consumables

-NO Talenttrees but perks (can be learned at 13,17,21,25) and attribute bonus (+3 / lvl; 6 levels, can be skilled at 2,5,8,11,14,17)

-XP and Gold bounties as in 6.88 

-Death Times as in 6.88 but more death time if killer is neutral ot tower for first levels to prevent suicide abuse

-Death Cost dependant on lvl instead of NW (30 times lvl + 50)



**To Do:

-Rework all boots to give constant ms instead of percentage, recode some items

-Adapt assist gold gain to 6.88

-XP assist gain as in 6.88

-Revert the huge rosh buffs and xp nerf (done)

-revert some ability changes, adapt CD, Castpoints, everything
