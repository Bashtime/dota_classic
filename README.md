Restoring DotA's old glory with some QOL elements and tweaks

Tweaks contain hero specific perks (think of 1-branched talents), 
old kill and gold mechanics before the introduction of "comeback mechanic",
non-linear XP Progress as it used to be.

QoL: UI Improvements


Now Implemented:
-XP per level required as in 6.88

-Stats from attributes slightly altered to be a mix between 6.8 era and modern dota, i.e.

  19 HP / str   0.05 Hp / sec / str (6.88: 0.03/sec and 20 HP)  default base reg: 0.15 (6.88: 0.25)   Base HP: 225 (6.88: 200)
  
  13 mana / int (6.88: 12 mana)  0.05 Mana / sec / int (6.88: 0.04)  Base Mana: 50 (6.88: 75)
  
  mana regen item like in modern dota (stronger early, worse late)
  
  
  1 armor / 7 agi, old armor formula (slightly stronger than current)
  1% spell amp / 14 int
  
-Added PMS / Aquila / Trident / Talon / Vambrace to main shop

-Better shop layout

-Attributes and stat gain of all heroes reverted to 6.88 (1-2 exceptions)

-approx. 15% of items have gold prices and recipes now reverted to 6.88 (work in progress)

-NO neutral drops

-NO Talenttrees but perks and attribute bonus (+3 / lvl)


To Do:

-Rework all boots to give constant ms instead of percentage, recode some items

-Adapt gold gain to 6.88

-Kill gold and xp gain (also neutrals and creeps, also their other stats)

-Revert the huge rosh buffs and xp nerf

-revert some ability changes, adapt CD, Castpoints, everything

-code every perk

-make centerBG panorama bigger

-Show HP/Mana of allies all the time

-Remove Outposts and add sideshops



Bugs:

-can only spend 20 instead of 25 skill points
